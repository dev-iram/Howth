This is a project I created as per specifications in City & Guilds Web Development module during the course of my FIT ICTAP Software Development apprenticeship.
This was the first project/coding we had done on the apprenticeship, so I know I could do so much better now, haha but we all have to start somewhere!

### Project Requirements
Having spoken to the customer, it has been made clear that a number of 
features are essential for this website. These include:  
  
✦ **Interactive features** -
The customer would like 2 interactive features displayed on the 
website.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ✧ *Contact Form* – this form will ask the user on the website for their 
name, subject, and a comment. This is a great way for any users on 
the website to ask any queries they may have, or just to leave a 
comment. It is vital for a webpage to have some form of contact 
options for the end-user.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ✧ *Interactive Google Map* – The customer has left it up to us to 
decide on another interactive feature for this website. After speaking 
to the customer, it has been decided that a good feature to add may 
be to add an interactive Google Map that highlights Howth on the 
map, so that users will be able to see the area, and surrounding 
area. This will be placed on the contact page.

✦ **Navigation bar** – the customer has required that there is a 
navigation bar that is the same on every page. They would like users 
to be able to navigate from any page, to any page. This would also 
include the headings of the five pages – Home, About, Contact, 
Tourism, Attractions

✦ **Logo** – A logo that is unique and that matches the colour scheme 
that has been outlined by the client. It is also essential that when the 
logo is clicked, it brings the user back to the homepage. 

✦ **Images** – The client has also made a note to say that they would
like the website to feature lots of images.

✦ **Email** – The client would like their email address, info@howth.ie to 
be displayed across every page. They do not have specific 
requirements as to where, but would like a simple design overall, so 
wherever it suits best. 

✦ **Animation** – The client has also asked that there is at least one 
animation on the website.

  There are also other features that the client has stated that would be 
nice, but are not by any means essential to the website, such as:  
  ✦ Pictures for attractions/hotels that link to other websites  
  ✦ Mobile friendly design  
  ✦ Bottom page navigation bar  
  ✦ Links to social media  
  ✦ Adding a section for comments from users who have visited 
attractions/hotels. Input and feedback from the users on their 
experiences  
  
The client has stated that they would like a five page website. These five 
pages include:  
  
  ✦ **Home** – The homepage should include a logo, a navigation bar 
(that will also be on each page), an image on the homepage that 
showcases Howth, 3 columns with content regarding attractions, 
hotels, experiences, and also an image of the map of Howth that 
can highlight some of the main attractions worth visiting.  
  
  ✦ **About** – This page should feature information about the town of 
Howth, its history, and a little bit about the http://www.howth.ie
organisation and the aim of the website.  
  
  ✦ **Contact** – This page should feature a form that a user is able to fill 
out. It will ask the user for their name, a subject, and any 
comments that they may have. The contact page will also feature 
contact information for the http://www.howth.ie organisation, such 
as an email to contact in regards to any inquiries, an address to 
the main company building and a telephone number.   

  ✦ **Tourism** – The client expects to see this page feature mostly text 
and a few images. They expect to find information about the 
history of Howth and maybe even links to a few hotels that tourists 
can visit.  

  ✦ **Attractions** – The client expects to find information about the main 
attractions in Howth. They are expecting images and text for this 
section. 
Each of these pages will feature the same logo and navigation bar at the 
top of the page, and they will also link into each other, so that the end 
user will be able to go from any page, to any other page on the website 
using the navigation bar at the top.
